Pythoncoin the qt is underdevelopment and I could use all the help you could give! With that out of the way lets describe how to use this application.

Pythoncoin is a cryptocoin that each adclient hosts, its used to keep track of clicks by submitting a transfer order live on each click to the db, this is also underconstruction.

The client is their own mint and can write up tos to cover a wide range of scam surfaces and social agreements on the abuse of ad clicking. 

In this senario each person who runs a client also owns a website (use noip and port forwarding to get going for free!)
This website serves that ad networks ads to the world via an adblock generator feature for the webdevelopers, each ad in the network you generate an ad set with has its own payout amounts and settings

Now we have to start up an xampp server to host our dashboard at our new noip address, as this is a windows application written in python. With website dashboard for immediate user interactions.
Navigate to the xampp folder in the C:/ directory and start the server with the start_xampp.exe. find the htdocs folder and add the dashboard8.php to it. Now you can goto your noip address and can see the dashboard! You will have to have some knowledge in setting up phpmyadmin or others.
Once the mysql, apache, HTTPServer and pythoncoin client are ready and live the netowrk is functional! 

The hook.
You know you see something you could advertise and take a picture of it! Or you sit down with someone and make a deal to host ad content (images/links/text)
Now you can start your client up and make an ad with that clients content to follow through with a contract to show their ads.
This makes a small trust circle possible so I've included the pythoncoin feature which makes each ad network a mint and transaction system.
In the future or by your own design you can create modifications to your own pyqt to get ahead in the advertising world.

Legal advertising only please.
